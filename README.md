# Quadrat

**Quadrat** is an open source app to help ecologists accurately measure the 
fractional cover of their quadrat.

Estimating species cover in a quadrat can be tricky, many ecologists eyeball it but this is a major source of systematic error when estimating cover.

It's easy to use: 

1. Tap on the camera button at the bottom left of the app
2. Snap a **birds eye** photo of your quadrat
3. Rearange the white square to the bounds of your quadrat
4. Shade in your species
5. Tap the "Estimate Coverage" button
